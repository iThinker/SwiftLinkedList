# SwiftLinkedList
Linked List implemenation in Swift.
For all your LRU Cache needs.

- Class based and multable by design. No COW.
- Int indicies.
- Accessing front and back - O(1).
- Modifying front and back - O(1).
- Random access and modification - O(n).
- Prepend is faster than Array, but append is much slower :'(
